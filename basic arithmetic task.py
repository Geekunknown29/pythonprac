QUESTION :-
make a program in which we take input of two variables and
after that 1st line prints sum,
second prints their difference and third line prints their product,
fourth prints floor division and fifth prints float division

"""a = int(input())
b = int(input())

#assert 1<=a<=10^10, "a and b must be greater than equal to 1 and less than equal to 10^10"
#assert 1<=b<=10^10, "a and b must be greater than equal to 1 and less than equal to 10^10"
print (a+b)
print (a-b)
print (a*b)
print (a//b)
print (a/b)
